#PyLadiesATX - Mentoring

## Pilot Mentoring Program : January - March 2016

PyLadiesATX will begin it's initial mentoring program in January 2016. Our goal is to inspire and retain more women in our Python community. After our pilot, we will begin a quarterly reevaluation and signups. 

We began this initiative in December 2015 with a call out for participants. Our inital program has 33 mentors and mentees. All mentees have been matched with mentors for our pilot.
