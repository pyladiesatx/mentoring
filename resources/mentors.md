Books have been written on Mentoring, but some general ideas to get you and your Mentee going are below. 

## Initial Steps

* Begin by getting to know your mentee and their goals
* Set up a plan on how you can best help them achieve those goals
* Set specific times to meet 
* Set expectations, for example:
	- Emails once or twice a week are ok. 
	- Can only commit to meeting times.
