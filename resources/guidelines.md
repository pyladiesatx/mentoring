## Pilot Program Guidelines

While we hope your connections are lasting, this program is a pilot and we've set minimum requirements. If you wish to continue your mentorship, please feel free. We want to be facilitators in your journey! 

### Minimum Requirements set out for the pilot

* Duration: 6 weeks
* Time Commitment: 1 hour a week meeting

### General Items to Consider

* Your time and your partners time are valuable
	- Please be present when you meet. Distractions during your meeting times can wreck a valuable relationship.
	- If you can't make a meeting, please let your partner know with as much advance notice as possible.
* Be realistic
	- When you have something to discuss at a meeting, send your mentor or mentee an email a day before so they can prepare for it. 
	- You'll be learning a lot, mentors and mentees alike, but sometimes you'll lose sight of it. Step back if you're losing steam and reassess. 
* Have fun
	- Don't forget to get to know each other. Not only are you partners in this journey, but you should also be able to trust each other and laugh at yourselves. Mistakes will be made, roll with it and remember you're both learning!
